## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  Functions allow code to be called several times without repetition.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  function keyword
  optional name
  a comma-separated list of zero or more parameters surrounded by parentheses
  the start of the function's code block indicated by an opening curly brace
  an optional return statement
  the end of the function's code block indicated by an opening curly brace

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  the syntax of calling a function requires the name of the function followed immediately by the arguments in parentheses

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A function call is much shorter to write as it doesn't include the code block that the function definition includes.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is a placeholder or variables for the arguments. Arguments are the actual values being passed through the function.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  They allow the codeblock to filled in with different values.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  produces a value we can use in our program
  prevents anymore code in the code block from being run
