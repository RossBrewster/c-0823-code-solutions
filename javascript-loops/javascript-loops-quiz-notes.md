## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  Loops allow us to repeat the same code multiple times.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  The condition determines whether or not the loop will iterate.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  Iteration is running the code block of the loop.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  The condition is checked before every loop iteration.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The initialization is checked once upon entering the loop.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The condition is checked before every loop iteration.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The final expression is executed every time the code block of the loop is executed.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  break

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  The ++ operator increments the operand by 1.

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  Use a "for..in" loop to iterate through the keys of an object.
