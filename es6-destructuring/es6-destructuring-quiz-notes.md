## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  destructuring provides an alternative way for you to assign variables to properties of an object.

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  declare the variable(s) with let or const, use curly braces to list the object properties you want as variables (if you want the variables to be named something different, follow each property name with a colon and the name of the variable you want), separate the properties with a comma, assign the variable to the object name.

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  use braces, and write the variable name in place of the corresponding index.

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  curly braces vs braces
